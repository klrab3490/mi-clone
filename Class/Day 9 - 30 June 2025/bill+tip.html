    <h1>Bill and Tip Calculation</h1>
    <p>This script calculates the tip based on the bill amount and logs the results.</p
    <p>Tips are calculated as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the bill is between 50 and 300, the tip is 15% of the bill.</li>
        <li>If the bill is outside this range, the tip is 20% of the bill.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The total amount to be paid is the sum of the bill and the tip.</p>
    <p>Check the console for the output of the calculations.</p>
    <h2>Example Bills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bill 1: $125</li>
        <li>Bill 2: $555</li>
        <li>Bill 3: $44</li>
    </ul>
    <script>
        let bills = [125, 555, 44];
        let tips = [];
        let totals = [];

        function calcTip(bill) {
            if (bill >= 50 && bill <= 300) {
                return bill * 0.15;
            } else {
                return bill * 0.2;
            }
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < bills.length; i++) {
            tips[i] = calcTip(bills[i]);
            totals[i] = bills[i] + tips[i];
            console.log(`The bill was for ${bills[i]}, then the tip is ${tips[i]} and the amount to be paid is ${totals[i]}`);
